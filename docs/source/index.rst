Welcome!

querqy.org is an umbrella for open source tools and libraries that
helps you create a powerful e-commerce search platform quickly, with a focus on
optimising search relevance from day one, beyond the out-of-the-box capabilities
of the Solr and Elasticsearch search engines.

What's included?
================

*Querqy*
  A query rewriting library. It helps you to tune your search results for
  specific search terms. It also comes with some query-independent search
  relevance optimisations. You can plugin in your own query rewriter. Available
  for Solr and Elasticsearch.
*SMUI*
  Search Management UI. A web UI to manage rules for query rewriting with
  Querqy (query-dependent synonyms, filters, boost/demote documents, ...)
  Supports rule management per language, multiple rule deployment targets,
  per-tenant rules. Currently available for Solr.
*Chorus*
  A Docker image that has Solr, Querqy and SMUI pre-installed to ramp up your
  search project quickly.

Where to go from here
