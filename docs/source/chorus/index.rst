Chorus
======

Chorus is a reference implementation for ecommerce search, and now comes in two
flavours, one for Solr and one for Elasticsearch.

Learn more through the `Meet Pete, the e-commerce search product manager
<https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2020/07/07/meet-pete-the-e-commerce-search-product-manager/>`_ blog and video series.

Installation
============

Chorus tries to strike a balance between making the getting started experience
quick and easy with also teaching you how all the elements of the Chorus stack
work together.  To that end, we stand up the stack using Docker Compose, but
then have you run all the various commands to integrate the elements together.
We provide a sample product data set for our mock ecommerce store, *Chorus Electronics*,
as part of this.
